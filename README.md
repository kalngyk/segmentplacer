# segmentplacer

This repository contains prototype implementations in D3.js for the algorithms in the paper [Placing Segments On Parallel Arcs](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-94667-2_25), meant to test the
feasibility of the algorithms therein. No compile needed. 

No external viewer required. Just download the files and: (1) open with browser to view the segment placements, or (2) open with text editor to examine the codes.
