# segmentplacer

This repository contains prototype implementations in D3.js for the algorithms in the paper "Placing Segments On Parallel Arcs", meant to test the
feasibility of the algorithms therein. No compile needed. No external viewer required. Just download the files and: (1) open with browser to view the segment placements, or (2) open with text editor to examine the codes.
